    "about": " As a fan of video games, I've enjoyed myself clearing each stage in various games such as strategy or RPG. Instead of addicting to games, I was thinking about how the game was developed and started to acquire the essential game development knowledge and practice programming. \n\n When the movie 'Ready Player One' launched in the theater, I was deeply impressed by the virtual world and cutting-edge technology on the screen, which increased my interest in game development until the COVID-19 pandemic hit us. \n\nHaving witnessed people losing their loved ones and family due to the unexpected virus and limited medical technology, I made up my mind to shift my focus to intelligent medical software development and aimed to make remarkable contributions. \n\nThus, during the end of my 3rd year in college, I have decided to continue seeking more education with an aim of software development by taking a master's degree. Apart from campus study, I am also actively seeking internship opportunities to accumulate hands-on industrial experience.",
